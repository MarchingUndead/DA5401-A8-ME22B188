Contents:

1. Data loading & preprocessing (ucimlrepo)  
-Discussing lookahead bias in train test split

2. Baseline models (Decision Tree, Linear Regression)  
- Explaining decomposition of error into bias and variance

3. Bagging  
-Reduction of variance

4. Gradient Boosting  
-Bias reduction

5. Stacking  
-Best of all worlds approach, combining adavntages while being robust, splitting and cross validation without lookahead bias.

6. Comparative RMSE results & plots
